# Specification

Here is some architectural knowledge to generate application by Rutile, 
and to use generated code for your concrete application.

## Schema

Rutile requires data world composed of Entity and Collection.

This presupposition provides all of the code generation, both in server and client.
If you are familiar with EJB, Enterprise Java Beans, you have an experience this kind of database design.

This design manner simplify and abstract data and application at all points.

### Entity

```
# Entity (Entity Name)
sequence:entitySeq(num)

	field*		type*	name*			search*		valid*		tags
	-----------+-------+---------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------
	entityID	int4	EntityID		SEARCH		VALID
	field1		TYPE	Field1 Name		SEARCH		VALID		TAGS
	field2		TYPE	Field2 Name		SEARCH		VALID		TAGS
	foreignID	int4	Foreign Name	SEARCH,join	VALID		helper:Segment/Entity
	  :			  :		  :				  :			  :			  :
```

The entityID is a sequential number generated by entitySeq defined above.
This is sometimes called as surrogate key or pseudo key.
Composite key is not allowed.

Its name should be a entity name starting with lower case character and with trailing ID.
The primary key might be written in entity<b>Id</b> in some other system.
But Rutile uses entity<b>ID</b> to explicitly define it is an ID.

The foreignID means a primary key of foreign entity.
This should be literally the key.

The foreign key usually have join and helper option in schema definition. 
This definition does not constraint your physical database, just a logical constraint.
So that you can define external database entity.

Generated sql file to setup your database does not have any FK constraint.
You can design your physical database as you like.

(You have to add join property for search section, and helper tag for tags section at the same time.
This is historical reason.)

### Collection

```
+-----------+                     +-----------+
| Collector |â—†---------+----------| Collected |
+-----------+          |          +-----------+
               +-------+--------+
               | Junction table |
               +----------------+


* CollectorCollected (Collector-Collected)

	collector/collected*					type*
	---------------------------------------+------
	CollectorSegment/Collector.collectorID	int4
	CollectedSegment/Collected.collectedID	int4
```

Collection means Collector has Collected entity, in other word, many-many relationship.
This is represented by junction table.

All of business entities might be defined by this style of database design.


## Client Server Protocol

```
+--------+                       +--------+
| Client |<---{app} WebSocket--->| Server |
+--------+                       +--------+
```

To use generated server function, client have to connect to the server with WebSocket,
and request a small object encapsulating application message.
This is called *app*.

Rutile generates SCRUD server functions as a method for each entity.
Those are named as, search, launch, get, register and remove.

Therefore, all operation for the specific entity can be described as "Segment/Entity.method".
This is a key of app, named as *apptag*.

The app should have apptag for the identifier of the server side application function.
Client makes a request to call the function with parameter for this identifier.

```javascript
var app = { apptag:"Segment/Entity.method", params:{parameters}, serial:1 };
```

For example, to get instances of "Product/Product" its productID is 1,2 and 3 will be composed as:

```javascript
var app = { apptag:"Product/Product.get", params:{ ids:[1,2,3] }, serial:1 };
```

The last element, serial, is a unique number in the client instance, to determine callback.

Actual request the *app* is contained in a context object, 
that is bidirectional root message object between client and server.

```javascript
var context = { request:[ app1, app2, ... ], serial:1 };
```

To send make request to the server, you have to pack app set with name request, and with serial number unique in you application instance.

All apps are executed in the order you defined in the request array.
After all, server returns context with response set with name of your request serial number.

```javascript
var context = { 'response,serial':[ app1, app2, ... ] };
```

Those responses also having apptag and serial, and the actual result is in *result* property instead of *params*.
Client can pick up callback for each response by them.

Following is general description of request and response object for each method.

### search

The search method accepts an object having keys, constraint, logic, orderby, scope and optionally expand.

The constraint keyword is a main keyword for search query.
This is an object containing search target and constraint value.

For example, searching entities "Product/Product", its name like "Apple" or "Orange", 
and its price is between 100 and 200, can be defined as:

```javascript
var app = {
	apptag: "Product/Product.search",
	params: {
		constraint: {
			"Product/Product.name(like)" : { values:["Apple","Orange"], logic:'OR' },
			"Product/Product.price(num)" : { min:100, max:200 }
		},
		logic : 'AND',
		orderby: { price : 'desc' },
		expand : 2
	}
};
```

The constraint keyword is composed of target segment, entity, field and search type in the brackets.
The expand keyword is depth of result instantiation, that means how many times recursively instantiate foreign keys.

Acceptable constraint format for each search type is following:

| type      | format                       | note                                          |
|:----------|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| key       | { values:[V], logic:AND/OR } | V: string or number                           |
| like      | { values:[V],logic:AND/OR }  | V: string or number                           |
| num       | { min:N, max:N }             | N: number, one or both                        |
| date      | { min:D, max:D }             | D: string represent date, one or both         |
| timestamp | { min:T, max:T }             | T: string represent timestamp, one or both    |
| nearby    | { values:[A], logic:AND/OR } | A: {centroid:'POINT(LON LAT)',distance:meter} |
| area      | { values:[A], logic:AND/OR } | A: {area:'POLYGON((LON LAT,...))'}            |

If you define *orderby* for the field, 
you can add a orderby keyword for your app request with sort target field as its key and desc or asc for its value.

The keyword logic can be defined for each search type and whole search object.

And if you define join for your field, searching foreign field can be available.
For example:

```javascript
var app = {
	apptag : "Order/OrderItem.search",
	params : {
		constraint: {
			"Order/OrderItem.name(like)" : { values:["Apple","Orange"] },
			"Product/Product.price(num)" : { min:100, max:200 }
		}
	}
};
```

If it contains external segment, server function will be automatically generated as dblink query.

```javascript
var instances = context['response,serial'][i].result;
```

The result set of search method is an array of instances.
You can get this array by app.result.

No implementation is generated for the Collection.

### launch

The launch method does not require any kind of parameters, just call with empty object.

```javascript
var app = { apptag:"Product/Product.launch", params:{}, serial:1 };
```

The result app object has a single object in the result property.

```javascript
var instance = context['response,serial'][i].result;
```

Retuned instance can be Entity and Collection both.

### get

The get method accepts a array of IDs you want to get instance.

```javascript
var app = { apptag:"Product/Product.get"  params:{ ids:[1,2,3], expand:1 }, serial:1 };
```

You can define depth of instantiation as expand.
The value expand:1 means do not load foreign entity, 
2 means instantiate foreign entity linked by foreign key field in the entity if it is defined.
3 means, and so on.

The result app is also having a array of instances.

```javascript
var instances = context['response,serial'][i].result;
```

Those instances can be both Entity and Collection.

### register

The register method accepts an object having keys, entities and bulk.

The keyword entities is an array of object that represent instance.

```javascript
var product = { productID:1, name:"Apple", price:100 } ;

var app = { apptag:"Product/Product.register", params:{ entities:[product], bulk:true  }, serial:1 }
```

The bulk flags means a selection for saving entire entity or individual fields value.
If the bulk flag is false, you can save individual field value.
Otherwise, server logic will fail if the instance does not have all required field value.
Even with the flag true, register method requires at least its primary key.

The result app object includes all saved instance.

```javascript
var instances = context['response,serial'][i].result;
```

Above described description is same for the Collection.

```javascript
var productProductImage = { productID:1, collection:[1,2,3] };

var app = { 
	apptag:"Product/ProductProductImage.register",
	params:{ entities:[productProductImage] },
	serial:1
};
```

But the bulk option is not affect in the Collection saving.

### remove

The remove method accepts a array of IDs you want to delete instance.

```javascript
var app = { apptag:"Product/Product.remove"  params:{ ids:[1,2,3], expand:1 }, serial:1 };
```

This method does not remove foreign entities recursively.
Therefore, if your entity has foreign entity only stand with the entity, you have to remove those entities independently.

The result app object contains removed IDs.

```javascript
var ids = context['response,serial'][i].result;
```

If you remove Collection, the semantics is different from Entity.
The remove method of Collection removes all of the entry in the junction table.
Therefore, if you want to remove a part of a collection,
at first remove all, then save the rest you want to leave.


## Server

Rutile's server side application is based on traditional container.

The container provides data persistent and object cacheing under the database transaction.
This is synchronous.

### Container

```
				           data persistent

       +-----------+           +-----+
       | Container +-----+-----+ DB1 |
       +-----+-----+     |     +-----+
             |           |   
object cache |           |     +-----+
             |           +-----+ DB2 |
         +---+---+       :     +-----+
         | Redis |       :
         +-------+
```

The container provides object cacheing, data persistent and transaction.

Container-object can be available from ContainerFactory defined in your generated package.
And connection information can be available in the file generated <i>APP_NAME</i>Server/<i>APP_NAME</i>Config/<i>APP_NAME</i>Config.js.
There is some default information defined, edit it for your env.

You can get container object for each database segment by specifying segment name.
The other way, you can bind multi-segment or all your segments.

```javascript
// specific segment
var container = ContainerFactory.getContainer('Segment1');

// multi-segment
var container = ContainerFactory.getContainer('Segment1','Segment2',...);

// all segments
var container = ContainerFactory.getContainer();

container.connect();
```

To use container, you must call init method to clean up cached instances that was used by previous session.

```javascript
container.init();
```

Transaction can be managed by transaction object made by container.
If the container bind multiple segments, transaction is also bound.

To start transaction, just call begin method.
The default is auto-commit mode.

You can set transaction isolation level and auto-commit mode individually.
And usual method is available.

You have to commit and close your transaction after your work.
Un-commited transaction will be aborted at the end of session.

```javascript
var tx = container.getTransaction();
tx.begin();

tx.setAutoCommit();
tx.isolationLebelSerializable();

// your works here

tx.commit();
tx.rollback();
tx close();
```

Object cache is provided by Redis.
It minimizes database access, and and makes instances for the same model for the same id identical in your session,
but does not provide any transaction.

```
var instance1 = Model.instantiate(1);
var instance2 = Model.instantiate(1);

instance1 === instance2; // true
```

### Logic

```
+----------+
| Frontend | (server.js)
+---+------+
    |
	| find a logic for the app
	| 
    |    +---------+
	+--->|  Logic  |
         +---------+
```

The entry point of server function is server.js, the frontend trigger for your app.

The server looks for appropriate application logic for requested apptag from LogicFactory that is generated in you server package.
The logic found by server is a function object that implement SCRUD.

```javascript
var method = LogicFactory.getMethod(apptag);
method(context,app);
```

The method, function object, gets context object and responsible app object.
The concrete implementation is provided by model.


### Model

Model class is preliminary generated according to your schema definition.
To manage your entity or collection, at first get a model class from your generated ModelFactory.
And then, instantiate by ID.

```javascript
var ModelFactory = APP_NAME.getModelFactory();
var EntityModel = ModelFactory.getModel('Segment/Entity');

var instance = EntityModel.instantiate(id);
```

Collection instance can be get in the same manner.

All of the model instances are managed by the container.
Therefore, as described above, the instance is always same object in the session.

Model implements concrete SCRUD function for the Entity and Collection.
Functions *SCR*, search and create, are defined as static method.
The rest *UD*, update and delete, are defined as instance method.

The life cycle of data persistent is following.

```javascript
var ids = Model.search(query);     // S:search
var id = Model.publishID();        // C:create
var instance = Model.instance(id); // R:read
instance.save();                   // U:update
instance.delete();                 // D:delete
```

### Sanitizing phase

The model implementation automatically sanitize you input data. 
This logic is automatically generated by your data type.

```javascript
instance.field = value;
```

For example, if you set string value for the field being numeric type field,
instance does not accept you input.

Indeed, this function simply sanitize the value, therefore no exception has been occurred.
In this case, the field will become 0.

| type      | sanitizing                              | default    |
|:----------|:----------------------------------------|:-----------|
| int       | evaluate as number                      | 0          |
| int2      | evaluate as number                      | 0          |
| int4      | evaluate as number                      | 0          |
| text      | evaluate as string                      | ''         |
| date      | evaluate as Date object, then stringify | null       |
| timestamp | evaluate as Date object, then stringify | null       |
| geography | evaluate as string                      | ''         |

Type geography is simply evaluated as string, not checked as POINT format.


### Validation phase

You can check whether your instance is having valid field data as you defined in schema definition.
This is provided by instance method *valid*.

```javascript
instance.valid();

instance.valid('fieldName');
```

Calling valid method without argument checks all field.
Otherwise, define a field name you want to check.
Both returns true or false.

| valid           | validation                                            |
|:----------------|:------------------------------------------------------|
| notNull         | true if some data in there                            |
| positiveValue   | true if the value is positive                         |
| negativeValue   | true if the value is negative                         |
| timestampString | true if the value is formatted as timestamp style     |
| dateString      | true if the value is formatted as date style          |
| emailString     | true if the value is formatted as email style         |
| geographyPoint  | true if the value is formatted as PostGIS point style | 
| helper          | true if the foreign entity exists                     |

If you define helper tag for your field, validation process try to find your foreign object.
And if the object exists correctly, returns true.

This behaviour seems to make trouble when you saving multiple entities depending each other by foreign key.
But don't worry.
Container returns same instance in the same session.

For example, Product/Product has Product/Product.productImageID field, its helper, foreign entity is Product/ProductImage, 
and both are fresh.

```javascript
var productID = Product.publishID();
var productImageID = ProductImage.publishID();

var product = Product.instance(productID);
var productImage = ProductImage.instance(productImageID);

product.price = 100;
product.productImageID = productImageID;
productImage.image = blob.toString();

product.save();
productImage.save();
```

The function call product.save() will look up the instance for productImageID in its internal validation phase,
but the container returns same instance already having your blob string just set above.
Hence not error.

This is the same thing whenever you call via websocket, while you are using *app* and *batchtag*. 

(Those are described in the section of Client too.)


### Constraint

Constraint is a internal representation of search query.

Rutile generates query compiler for each entity named SQLMaker.
It gets the request object created by UI, described in above, 
and makes intermediate constraint objects, then makes sql expression of them.

All of query elements are preliminary generated as class definition.

For example, 
searching Product/Product entity, its product class name likes some value, under condition of Product/Product.productClassID is defined with helper Product/ProductClass, is generated as a file of:

```
Constraint/Product/Product/SelectbyProductClassProductClassNameLike.js
```

The format is:

```
Constraint/<Traget Segment>/<Target entity>/Selectby<Search entity><Search field><Search type>.js
```

This is why you have to define unique entity name across all segments.

(Of course the file name can be generated as including search segment, but not nowadays...)

### Component overriding (Impl)

Rutile generates symmetric package for your main APP_NAME package named <i>APP_NAME</i>Impl under the same directory of it.

The package has symmetric directory structure for the main package.
You can override module by putting override module into the appropriate location and modify Factory being there.

For example, following module overrides ProductImage model definition of DemoShop schema.

```javascript
var DemoShop = require('DemoShop');
var ModelFactory = DemoShop.getModelFactory();
var ProductImageModel = ModelFactory.getModel('Product/ProductImage');
var ParentConstructor = ProductImageModel.getClass;

function ModelConstructor(){
	var instance = new ParentConstructor(arguments);
	
	// wrapping the save method
	var orig_save = instance.save;
	instance.save = function(){
		console.log("I am save method, wrapped by implementation!");
		orig_save();
	};
	
	return instance;
}

module.exports = {
	getClass      : ModelConstructor,                   // override
	publishID     : ProductImageModel.publishID,        // delegate to the parent
	instance      : ProductImageModel.instantiate,      // delegate to the parent
	search        : ProductImageModel.search,           // delegate to the parent
	ids           : ProductImageModel.ids,              // delegate to the parent
	fieldManifest : ProductImageModel.getFieldManifest, // delegate to the parent
};
```

## Client

```
index (list of entities)
      |
      |
	  V
+------------+         +------------+
|    List    |<------->|  EditForm  | 
+------------+         +------------+
      ^ 
      | 
      v
+------------+
| SearchForm | 
+------------+
```

Rutile generates KitchenSink application that is combination of three basic functions, List, EditForm and SearchForm at the end.

The *index* is a list of all your Entities.

Selecting one of them, shows the list of instances, or rows, in the entity.
And selecting one of them, shows the detail of values the instance having.

The list has a button to bring up SearchForm, having possible patterns according to your schema definition.
And also, this list has a function to delete some instances.


### Model

Client side model is a facade object for its data management and UI interaction.
This is not Alloy's model.

Model also provide SCRUD method.
Functions *SCRD* are provided as static method.
The rest *U* is provided as instance method.
Those methods are bit different to the server side model interface, to simplify callback.
Yes, data interaction in client side components are implemented as async structure.

The life cycle of data persistent is following.

```javascript
// S:search
Model.search({
	query    : { valid query described in the section of Client Server protocol },
	batchtag : 'apptag binder',
	callback : function(){ 'you can get search result here!'; },
});

// CR:create and read
Model.instantiate({
	primaryKeys : [array of ID you want to get instance],
	expand      : depth of instantiation,
	batchtag    : 'apptag binder',
	callback    : function(){ 'you can get instances here!'; }
});

// U:update
instance.save({
	batchtag : 'apptag binder',
	callback : function(){ 'you can get saved instance here!'; }
});

// D:delete
Model.remove({
	ids      : [array of ID you wan to remove],
	batchtag : 'apptag binder',
	callback : function(){ 'you can get removed ids here!'; }
});
```
To modify your entity, you can use usaul method.

```javascript
instance.field = value;
```

You see several *batchtag* properties.
This is a binder to serialize multiple apps.

The app is a small package of application.
Keyword of batchtag makes a batch to the server call, so that execute those fragments together.
Bound apps will be executed in the same context, in other word in the same session.
Those are also executed in the order you called methods with the same batchtag.

For example, in the case, saving a fresh Product instance having foreign key productImageID, and its linked entity ProductImage is also fresh,
you have to save them with same batchtag.

```javascript
var Dispatch = require('CentralDispatch'); // singleton

productImage.save({
	batchtag : 'saving product',
	function : function(){ console.log('image saved'); },
});

product.save({
	batchtag : 'saving product',
	function : function(){ console.log('image saved'); },
});

Dispatch.sync('saving product'); // actual invocation of save
```

The CentralDispatch is a framework provided by Rutile as a singleton object.
Calling a save method generates an *app* representing its operation, and push it into the queue of CentralDispatch.
Therefore your methods call anywhere in your application with same batchtag will be invoked in the same context when the sync was called.
And those apps are executed in the server by its order you push in.

(In above sample snippet, the first line is just for demonstration, you dont have to call it before save, but just before Dispatch.sync in the last.)

(Client side model should have sanitizing and validation phase like server side model.
But not yet implemented.)


### CentralDispatch

As mentioned above, CentralDispatch is a framework provided in Rutile client.

This module encapsulates application call for the server, and manages series of apps by batchtag.

In Rutile generated UI application, application function is fragmented in small package of app.
So usually tracking serial number and managing callback makes code unreadable.

CentralDispatch encapsulates these things.
You can make *app* request object that having only your business logic.

```javascript
var Dispatch = require('CentralDispatch');

var work1 = function(instances){
	instances.map(function(instance){ console.log(instance); });
};

var app1 = {
	apptag   : "Product/Product.get",
	params   : { ids:[10,20,30] },
	callback : work1
};

Dispatch.sync(app1);
```

The sync method of CentralDispatch immediately execute your app.

```javascript
var tag = 'my series of work';

var work2 = function(instances){
	instances.map(function(instance){ console.log(instance); });
};

var app2 = {
	apptag   : "Product/TopSales.get",
	params   : { ids:[1,2,3] },
	callback : work2
};

Dispatch.push(tag,app1);
Dispatch.push(tag,app2);
Dispatch.sync(tag);
```

On the other hand, push method with tag stacks your works in its queue, 
then executed them when the sync method was called.

This is useful if some works have dependencies.
Bound apps will be executed in the same context, iOW same session, in the sever.
This is indispensable function like saving entity having fresh foreign entity.

In client side, stacked callback will be also executed in the order you push.
But this does not guarantee that those callbacks are serialized.
Callbacks follow standard JavaScript manner.

If your callbacks depend on each other in your data oriented application,
it is a sign that you can get more better schema and UI design.

FYI, the implementation of CentralDispatch that calls back is following.

```javascript
socket.once(response_event,function(context){
	var responses = context.response;
	for( var i=0; i<responses.length; i++ ){
		var response = responses[i];
		var apptag = response.apptag;
		var result = response.result;
		var serial = response.serial
		var callback = callbacks[serial];
		callback(result);
		delete callbacks[serial];
	}
});
```

BTW, the name CentralDispatch is just for fun ;)


### NotificationCenter

NotificationCenter is an event propagation module provided by Rutile client framework.

You know this kind of module everywhere in complex JavaScript UI application.

NotificationCenter has usual methods notify, listen/once, and remove like following.

```javascript
var Notifier = require('NotificationCenter');

Notifier.notify(EVENT_NAME,object);

Notifier.listen(EVENT_NAME,callback);
Notifier.once(EVENT_NAME,callback);

Notifier.remove(EVENT_NAME);
```

If you forget to remove your registration for NotificationCenter, your callback will leak.


### Navigation

Rutile provides generic navigation controller like in iOS objective-c system, just named as NavigationGroup.

To use this navigation system, you have to add it to your index.xml at first.

```xml
<Alloy>
	<Window>
		<Require src="Framework/NavigationGroup" id="NavigationGroup"/>
	</Window>
</Alloy>
```

And in the controller of this view, the index.js, load your first Alloy controller.
Then open it.

```javascript
var navi = $.NavigationGroup;
navi.setRootWindow($.index);
navi.enableBackButton();

var entityList = Alloy.createController("/KitchenSink/EntityList");
navi.open(entityList);
```

This is the part of actual code to be generated for your schema.

Controllers you opened by this protocol can enjoy the benefit of several iOS like method callbacked 
at the timing of view life cycle.

```javascript
exports.viewDidLoad = function(){
	navi = Alloy.Globals.navigationControllerStack[0];
	updateView();
};

exports.viewWillAppear = function(){
	var rootWin = navi.getRootWindow();
	rootWin.add(infoPanel.getView());
	infoPanel.restorePosition();
};

exports.viewWillDisappear = function(){
	var rootWin = navi.getRootWindow();
	rootWin.remove(infoPanel.getView());
	infoPanel.resumePosition();
};
```

Method *viewDidLoad* will be called at the view has been loaded by NavigationGroup.
In this phase, getting the navigation instance is a recommended way to manage your navigation.
And also, you have to setup your controller's view component here.

The component in you view will be loaded at the timing of the controller is instantiated by Alloy framework.
Method viewDidLoad is the almost same timing as this.

Method *viewWillAppear* will be called at the view will be actually shown in the view rect of your application.
This is useful to activate functions that should be stopped while the view is not shown for user.

Last method *viewWillDisappear* will be called at the timing the view will be actually invisible from your view rect. 
In the opposite direction of viewWillAppear, this method is useful for the the functions that should be inactivated while the view is not visible.

NavigationGroup provides several utility for your view, here is abstruct.

| open              | instance of Alloy controller  | open new controller                       |

Additionally, you can use ModalWindow to open new controller under the model.
This modal method creates new NavigtionGroup.
And push it to the Alloy.Global.navigationStack.
When the modal been closed, remove self from the stack.

For more detail, see Framework/NavigationGroup.js and Framework/ModalWindow.js in your generated client package, 
and your generated product itself.


### Component made by Framework

The final output of Rutile is a KitchenSink TiApp that covers all of possible basic UI comes from your schema design.

As described in the ReadMe.md, generated application has following component stack.

```
+-----------------+
|   KitchenSink   | Generated App covering all Components
+-----------------+
| Component/Model | Generated UI components and Models
+-----------------+
|    Framework    | Rutile client framework
+-----------------+
|      Alloy      |
+-----------------+
```

Rutile generates UI components to show, edit and search your data from abstract UI component implemented in client Framework.
Show and Edit are made from component group named as EditFormElement* implemented in the Framework.
EditFormElement beeing in un-editable mode represents show function of the data.

Search is made from component group named as SearchFormElement* also in the Framework.

The final product is an application to show, edit and search your entire entity relation.

If your entity has a foreign key as a field, its editor should have selector for the linked entity.
If your entity has a image type field, its editor should have image selector accessing to your local album.
If your entity has a aggregation, in other words collection, its editor should have selector to pick up collecting entity bind to self.

Those are same for searching.
If your entity has a foregin key as a field, its search form should have a form to define field value you want to constraint search query, bla bla bla.

Each edit form and search form function is very basic function, that can be defined by your schema definition.
For instace, number type value will be edited by text field UI, and will be searched by less than, more than or in range.
But integrating them as a single application that having ratinal page transaction is little bit complex.

Rutile actualizes this work to generate intermediate components made by abstruct element, that is by EditFormElement* and SearchFormElement*.

Those components are generated in the Component directory in your generaged client package.
You are able to use them for your own application implementation as a part of it.

And combination of those Component with Model, NavigationGroup, CentralDispatch for remote access and NotificationCenter for local event propagation realizes application itself.


#### EditFormElement

| type           | Base Framework module     | note                                     |
|:---------------|:--------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| primary key    | EditFormElementPrimaryKey | if the key is primary key                |
| int,int2,int4  | EditFormElementInt        |                                          |
| text           | EditFormElementTextArea   | if having tag editor:textArea            |
| text           | EditFormElementTextField  | if having tag editor:textField (default) |
| date           | EditFormElementDate       |                                          |
| timestamp      | EditFormElementTimestamp  |                                          |
| image          | EditFormElementImage      |                                          |
| geography      | EditFormElementLocation   |                                          |
| extkey         | EditFormElementExtkey     | if having tag helper:ENTITY              |
| extentity      | EditFormElementExtentity  | if this is a collection item             |

The implementation of Alloy controller to edit your field is generated according to your field type into the location of controllers/Component/EditForm/Segment/Entity/Field.js.
Its file name is defined as field name starting with upper case charator.
Corresponding styles and views are also generated in the same manner.

For example, the editor for Product/Product.price should be defined as controller/Component/EditForm/Product/Product/Price.js.

The generated editor implements collaboration with Model.
In the example, the Price.js editor listen and notify data change with Product model, each other.

To enable this form and model binding, you have to use EditFormGroup described below.

If your entity has collection, editor for the collection is also generated in controllers/Component/EditForm/Segment/Entity/Collection/CollectedEntityName.js.

For above example, if the Product entity has collection, that collecting Product/ProductImage, controllers/Component/EditFormSegment/Product/Product/Collection/ProductImage.js should be generated.
This collection edit form provides ProductImage picker and show the list of collected ProductImage.


#### SearchFormElement

| type           | Base Framework module      |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| key            | SearchFormElementKey       |
| like           | SearchFormElementLike      |
| num            | SearchFormElementNum       |
| date           | SearchFormElementDate      |
| timestamp      | SearchFormElementTimestamp |
| nearby         | SearchFormElementNearby    |
| area           | SearchFormElementArea      |

The implementation of Alloy controller to search your data is also generated according to your field search type definitions into the location of controllers/Component/SearchForm/Segment/Entity/SelectbyTargetentityTargetfieldType.js.

Its file name is defined as constraint entity name, its field name and search type with prefix 'Selectby'.
Correspoinding styles and views also there.

For example, the search form to search Product/Product by match full of Product/ProductClass.productClassName linked by Product/Product.productClassID foreign key definition should be defined as contollers/Component/SearchForm/Product/Product/SelectbyProductClassProductClassNameKey.js.

Your search query should be generated by all SearchForm impelmentation on your concrete application.
This is provied by SearchFormGroup you can get at Rutile client Framework.


### EditFormGroup (Form Model binding)

To make link between your edit form and its corresponding model, 
you have to put your Alloy view element representing implementation of EditFormElement and instance of Model into the EditFormGroup.
The linkage will be automatically established by its name.

```javascript
var EditFormGroup = require('EditFormGroup');
var group = EditFormGroup.makeGroup(UNIQUE_NAME);

group.setForms([$.FORM,$.FORM2]);
formGroup.setModels([instance]);

formGroup.activate();
```

EditFormGroup requires unique name across your application, so that identify appropriate event.

After you make instance of EditFormGroup by makeGroup() method, just add your list of forms and instances by method of setForms() and setModels().
You can add forms and instances being for different Entities.
EditFormGroup will identify those aspect and automatically bind appropriately.

Calling activate() actually start form and model binding.
You can also manually synchronize specific timing by calling syncEntityToForm() or syncFormToEntity(), the former applies entity's field data to bound form, and the latter applies form value to the bound model.


### SearchFormGroup

The implementation of SearchFormElement supports you to get a constraint object for the specific field.
And SearchFormGroup supports for the combination of those implementations.

Your actual search application may have several elements to input field data, to select search logic, and to select orderby field,
and the *params* for *app* should be created as a combination of them.
To get query object for your search app, just add your forms to the SearchFormGruop with definition of the search target entity.

```javascript
var SearchFormGroup = require('SearchFormGroup');
var group = SearchFormGroup.makeGroup({
	'name'    : "Segment/Entity",
	'segment' : "Segment",
	'entity'  : "Entity",
});

group.addElements([$.FORM,$.FORM2]);

group.setLogicSelector($.Logics);
group.setOrderbys($.Orderbys);
```

The group should be initialized by unique name, and Segment and Entity to be selected.
The name typically defined as its full segment name.

Logic selector and orderby selector also generated in your client package.

```javascript
group.setSubmitAction({
	'form'    : $.Submit,
	'handler' : function(){
		Notifier.notify('Segment/Entity.searchQueryChanged',{
			'query'           : group.getQuery(),
			'constraintTexts' : group.getTextExpressionOfConstraint(),
			'logicText'       : group.getTextExpressionOfLogic()
		});
		navi.close();
	}
});
```

To execute your search, set your handler to the group using setSubmitAction() method.
In the above sample code, clicking $.Submit notifies query to the List page that listening(waiting) for your query.


### KitchenSink made by Component

Finally, TiApp generated as a combination of all above components as your KitchenSink.

It has three main pages, List, Editor and SearchForm.
Those are generated for two version. One is for application main path, and one is for reuse.


#### List(Reusable)

```
+----------------------+     +----------------------+
| <  EntityList (S)(+) |     | <  EntityList (S)(+) |
+----------------------|     +----------------------|
| â–¡ instance         > |     | instance           > |
| -------------------- |     | -------------------- |
| â–¡ instance         > |     | instance           > |
| -------------------- |     | -------------------- |
| â–¡ instance         > |     | instance           > |
| -------------------- |     | -------------------- |
| â–¡ instance         > |     | instance           > |
| -------------------- |     | -------------------- |
| â–¡ instance         > |     | instance           > |
| +------------------+ |     | -------------------- |
| | Query            | |     | instance           > |
| |    details...    | |     | -------------------- |
+----------------------+     +----------------------+

* with gadget                * simple reusable
```

The index of your TiApp is a list of all entities.
Tapping an entity navigates you to the List of selected entity.
At first, the List simply select all this entity limiting by Config.txt definition.

Rutile generates two version of List controller.
One is some gadget and the other simply list instances.

The former controller is just for application main path, to create and delete instances and navigate several different searching.
The latter is for reuse.
When you select a foreign key in EditForm, UI brings up a selector to pick up an entity with selection of create new one, select from list or search.
Reusable List controller is for this, that don't need gadget.

The List for main path is generated as KitchenSink/Segment/Entity/List.js, and reusable version is as ListReusable.js in the same loc.


#### EditForm(Reusable)

```
+----------------------+     +----------------------+
| <     Editor     (E) | ==> | X      Editor      V |
+----------------------|     +----------------------|
| Entity               |     | Entity               |
| +------------------+ |     | +------------------+ |
| |FLD : value       | |     | |FLD : value       | |
| +------------------+ |     | +------------------+ |
| |FLD : value       | |     | |FLD : value       | |
| +------------------+ |     | +------------------+ |
| |FLD : value       | |     | |FLD : value       | |
| +------------------+ |     | +------------------+ |
| Collection           |     | Collection           |
| +------------------+ |     | +------------------+ |
| |Collected         | |     | |Collected         | |
| +------------------+ |     | +------------------+ |
+----------------------+     +----------------------+

* click (E) to editable mode
* reusable version has same visual, but different internal
```

In the main path, selecting an instance navigate you to the detail view of it.
Un-editable mode of EditForm is for viewing.
When you tap edit button on it, it alters its mode to be editable.

Main path version and reusable version has a same visual.
But different internal function.
The former returns to the List with a query to select a new instance, 
the latter will be only called from selector brought up by EditForm to pick up target entity for a foreign key.

In the same manner, EditForm will be generated as KitchenSink/Segment/Entity/EditForm.js, and reusable version is as EditFormReusable.js in the same loc.

#### SearchForm(Reusable)

```
+----------------------+     +----------------------+
| X    SearchForm      | ==> | <  ResultList (S)(+) |
+----------------------|     +----------------------|
| Field(type)          |     | instance           > |
| AND|OR           (+) |     | -------------------- |
| +------------------+ |     | instance           > |
| | value            | |     | -------------------- |
| +------------------+ |     | instance           > |
| Field(type)          |     | -------------------- |
| AND|OR           (+) |     | instance           > |
| +------------------+ |     | -------------------- |
| | from ~ to        | |     | instance           > |
| +------------------+ |     | -------------------- |
|                      |     | instance           > |
|       [Search]       |     | -------------------- |
+----------------------+     +----------------------+

* [Search] to show List
* reusable version has same visual, but different internal
```

Both main path version and reusable version of SearchForm have same visual. 
That contains all elements generated as SearchFormElemnt for the current entity.

The different between those two version is action for the submit.
SearchForm for the main path returns back to the List with gadget, and the rest is notify for its listener.

SearchForm will be also generated as KitchenSink/Segment/Entity/SearchForm.js, and reusable version is as SearchFormReusable.js.
